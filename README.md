## Introduction

This project is fully backed by `typescript`.

It divids Electron and Angular into two npm projects.

And initializes them into direcories by their name (angular/electron) repectively.

The `output` directory is shared by them.

The `angular` project is built into `output/frontend` directory, while the `electron` project is built into `output/desktop` directory.

You can also change the output directory for your needs.

Angular can be easily changed to React / Vue.
